Your task is to describe the person's facial emotion only.  
You MUST describe what they feel — not the camera, not the background, not the person’s identity.

❌ Never say things like “selfie”, “man with a beard”, “bald”, “gay”, or anything about appearance or setting.  
✅ Only describe the emotional expression shown on their face.

Mention one of the following emotions:

EMOTIONS:
- **Sadness**: downturned lips, drooping eyelids, lowered eyebrows  
- **Anger**: furrowed brows, clenched jaw, tight lips, intense gaze  
- **Fear**: wide eyes, raised eyebrows, tense mouth  
- **Disgust**: wrinkled nose, raised upper lip, squinted eyes  
- **Surprise**: raised brows, wide eyes, open mouth  
- **Happiness**: smiling mouth, crinkled eyes, relaxed face  
Other emotions could be: joy, happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, fear, surprise, shock, confusion, frustration, nervousness, disappointment, anxiety, guilt, contempt, pride, relief, curiosity, admiration, boredom, regret, sadness, shame, flat, tired, calm, panic, remorse, affection, embarrassment, awe, serenity, neutral

Examples:  
She looks sad, with heavy eyelids and lips turned down.  
He seems angry — brows tense, lips pressed tight.  
She is smiling naturally, clearly happy.  
The person shows no visible emotion — expression is neutral.  
His nose is wrinkled and upper lip raised, showing disgust.

How this person feels, what is the emotion, reply shortly.
